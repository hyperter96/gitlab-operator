## Set up environment

### Set up Podman

```shell
podman login registry.gitlab.com
```

### Set up Docker

If you're not using `podman` for all tasks, authorize Docker to access `registry.gitlab.com`:

```shell
docker login registry.gitlab.com
```

### Set up Git

Ensure `user.name` and `user.email` are configured in Git.

For additional variables look at [Provision and deploy](provision_and_deploy.md) and [OperatorHub publishing](operatorhub_publishing.md)

Create `test_olm.env` in Operator's root dir (or point to a file in a custom location using `${OLM_TESTING_ENVIRONMENT}` environment variable)

Make sure to confirm every following customization line reflects **your personal** setup:

```shell
export OPERATOR_VERSION="0.10.2"
export OPERATOR_SDK="${HOME}/bin/operator-sdk_linux_amd64"
export BUNDLE_REGISTRY="registry.gitlab.com/dmakovey/gitlab-operator-bundle"

export PREVIOUS_OPERATOR_VERSION="0.9.1"
export LOCAL_IP="192.168.3.194"
export DO_NOT_PUBLISH="yes" # do not re-compile and publish bundle/catalog
                            # use the ones already published
```

## Prepare KinD Cluster (Optional)

To run tests in KinD cluster with OLM set up:

```shell
scripts/test_olm.sh setup_kind_cluster
```

Otherwise current `kubectl` context should point to an existing cluster that has OLM pre-installed

## Running tests

1. Setup KinD cluster and deploy Operator there:

   ```shell
   scripts/test_olm.sh upgrade_test_step1
   ```

   Operator Pod should be up and running. Confirm by running:

   ```shell
   kubectl get pod -n gitlab-system -l control-plane=controller-manager
   ```

1. Deploy "old" version of GitLab via Operator:

   ```shell
   scripts/test_olm.sh upgrade_test_step2
   ```

   Confirm GitLab has been deployed:

   ```shell
   kubectl get -n gitlab-system gitlab
   ```

1. Upgrade the *Operator*:

   ```shell
   scripts/test_olm.sh upgrade_test_step3
   ```

   Confirm that Operator has been upgraded.

   **Wait** for the install to roll out before next step

1. Upgrade GitLab:

   ```shell
   scripts/test_olm.sh upgrade_test_step4
   ```

   Confirm that GitLab has been upgraded and is functional

   **Wait** for the upgrade to complete

1. Confirm GitLab is running:

   ```shell
   scripts/test_olm.sh check_gitlab
   ```

   above will query Operator for GitLab status, alternatively use

   ```shell
   scripts/test_olm.sh check_gitlab2
   ```

   which bypasses Operator checks and runs checks against GitLab instance itself.
