# GitLab Operator

The GitLab Operator is an installation and management method that follows the
[Kubernetes Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

Use the GitLab Operator to run GitLab in
[OpenShift](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/openshift_and_gitlab/index.html) or on
another Kubernetes-compatible platform.

## Installation

Instructions on how to install the GitLab Operator can be found our [installation document](installation.md).

We list [known limitations](#known-limitations), and details of how we use

You should also be aware of the [considerations for SSH access to Git](git_over_ssh.md), especially
when using OpenShift.
